# Bargaining Game Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a two-player bargaining game where players simultaneously or sequentially demand points from a fixed pie of 100. 
The analysis includes:
- **Part 1 (Analytical Scientist):** Pure-strategy equilibria derived analytically.
- **Part 2 (Computational Scientist):** Normal form equilibria solved via NashPy, and extensive form SPNE analyzed using Game Theory Explorer.

## Repository Structure
- `report/`: Contains the final report (PDF) and figures.
- `code/`: Contains Colab/Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.
- `data/`: (Optional) Any data files if used.

## Tools Used
- Python (NashPy, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Game Theory Explorer (GTE)
- LaTeX/Word (for report writing)

## How to Run
1. Open `code/normal_form.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run the notebook to reproduce payoff matrices and Nash equilibria.
